# Data-visualization-with-D3
##Summary: 
The project aims to give an overview of SolarCity's business milestones and a glimpse of the solar industry from the falling of solar PV price to raise of third-party-owned business model.<br>
The indexFinal.html stores the storyline. It pulls charts from separated html files such as barChartFinal, barChartUtilityFinal, StockChartFinal and withNoteFinal in "data" folder. 

##Design:
The first TimeSeries Chart as in withNoteFinal shows SolarCity stockprice since its IPO. As said in the html file, this chart will not serve as the explanation for the fluctuation in SolarCity's stockprice although several events happened around a specific period partially help illustrate the stock's direction in that period. The design purpose of putting notes and news alongside the fluctuation in stockpricey is to use the timeline in stockprice as the anchor for highlights in the business milestone and events happening around the company. This technique is believed to help reader remember those facts easily and clearly as the storyline progresses. In fact, 3 viewers of this chart express a good knowledge of the company after reading through those events, which serves exactly what this chart is expected to do. Moreover, the chart has the capacity to accomodate more stories across the company's lifespan. <br>
FirstSolar stock chart helps illustrate some of important events in the solar industry. Tooltip and zoom effect were added to help assist the visualization.<br>
The next chart shows the correlation between falling solar PV price and rising total MW installation of solar power. To illustrate this relationship, a combination of time series line chart and bar chart is used. <br>
In the period of exciting solar activity (2010-2015), number of residential customers and residential electricity sold back to the grid increase quickly, which is shown through the subsequent bar and line chart. <br>
The final 3 charts show how SolarCity outperforms some of its competitors. The time series line chart show the increase in MW installation of SolarCity in comparation with other TPOs.<br>
The Bar Charts compares SolarCity installation accomplishment with other utility competitors and shows its ranking. The small "sort values" option in the left corner of the chart helps sort the chart in descending order. Color SolarCity bar with green and add the "sort values" option just aims to increase visualiation of the chart.<br> 

##Feedback:<br> 
Feedback for Bar Chart: the chart should be sorted to show companies' ranking (change from barChart1.html to barChartFinal.html).<br>
Feedback for StockChart: mousemove & tooltips are included because a reader wants to have more interaction with the chart as well as look at the real figure of the stock price (change from stockChart1.html to stockChartFinal.html) <br>
Feedback for index file: after putting the chart together, I was suggested to accompany the visualization with some stories to embed the intended messages. <br>
Feedback from reviewer: After reviewing index2.html file, reviewer feedbacks that there are no findings with the data as the first SolarCity stock chart with note only provides facts about the company, and the other 3 charts don't have any specific information either. Therefore, in indexFinal.html, I have included 3 more charts to show the correlation between falling PV price and escalating PV installation, and how  SolarCity has outgrew some of its competitors. The stockchart of FirstSolar remains to tell part of the story of the industry, although SolarCity's stock price was removed as comparing these 2 stocks are not the main purpose of the chart.<br>

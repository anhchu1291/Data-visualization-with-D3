# Data-visualization-with-D3
##Summary: 
The project aims to tell story of SolarCity with D3.js visualization.The indexFinal.html stores the whole storyline. It pulls charts from separated html files such as barChartFinal, barChartUtilityFinal, StockChartFinal and withNoteFinal in "data" folder. 

##Design:
The first TimeSeries Chart as in withNoteFinal shows SolarCity stockprice since its IPO. The notes put alongside the fluctuation in stockprice highlights the business milestone and events happening around the company.<br> 
The Bar Charts help compare SolarCity installation accomplishment with other competitors and shows its ranking.<br> 
The comparative Line Chart between SolarCity and FirstSolar illustrates the fluctuation in both companies' stock price and events in the solar industry. 
		
##Feedback:<br> 
Feedback for Bar Chart: the chart should be sorted to show companies' ranking (the change from barChart1.html to barChartFinal.html).<br>
Feedback for StockChart: mousemove & tooltips are included because a reader wants to have more interaction with the chart as well as look at the real figure of the stock price. <br>
Feedback for index file: after putting the chart together, I was suggested to accompany the visualization with some stories because some readers have very hard time understanding what the stockchart between SolarCity and FirstSolar highlights.

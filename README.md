# Data-visualization-with-D3
##Summary: 
The project aims to tell story of SolarCity with D3.js visualization.<br>
The indexFinal.html stores the storyline. It pulls charts from separated html files such as barChartFinal, barChartUtilityFinal, StockChartFinal and withNoteFinal in "data" folder. 

##Design:
The first TimeSeries Chart as in withNoteFinal shows SolarCity stockprice since its IPO. As said in the html file, this chart will not serve as the explanation for the fluctuation in SolarCity's stockprice although several events happened around a specific period partiall help illustrate the stock's direction in that period. The design purpose of putting notes and news alongside the fluctuation in stockprice is to use the timeline in stockprice as the anchor for highlights in the business milestone and events happening around the company. This technique is believed to help reader remember those facts easily and clearly as the storyline progresses. In fact, 3 viewers of this chart express a good knowledge of the company after reading through those events, which serves exactly what this chart is expected to do. Moreover, the chart has the capacity to accomodate more stories across the company's lifespan. 
<br> 
The Bar Charts compares SolarCity installation accomplishment with other competitors and shows its ranking. The small "sort values" option in the left corner of the chart helps sort the chart in descending order.<br> 
The comparative Line Chart between SolarCity and FirstSolar illustrates the fluctuation in both companies' stock price and events in the solar industry. 
		
##Feedback:<br> 
Feedback for Bar Chart: the chart should be sorted to show companies' ranking (change from barChart1.html to barChartFinal.html).<br>
Feedback for StockChart: mousemove & tooltips are included because a reader wants to have more interaction with the chart as well as look at the real figure of the stock price (change from stockChart1.html to stockChartFinal.html) <br>
Feedback for index file: after putting the chart together, I was suggested to accompany the visualization with some stories because some readers have very hard time understanding what the stockchart between SolarCity and FirstSolar highlights.

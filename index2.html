			<p class = "text">The time-series chart below shows SolarCity stock price in tandem with First Solar's. Although it's not necessarily useful to compare two stocks without considering the trading volume, the fluctuation in First Solar Stock shows intesting events in the solar industry.</p> 
			<p class = "text">First Solar is one of the biggest and long-established competitor of SolarCity. Founded in 1999, First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) leads the US's solar power industry in both solar cell and solar panel production. The company launched its initial public offering on November 17, 2006. From its starting price of $20, the share price broke $300 in April 2008, and for years the price bounced between the $100 and $200 range. Solar was a promising industry during the year of solar hype in 2008 - 2009, and First Solar was a frontrunner. However, The drop in solar panel prices rocked the industry in 2011. Between January and December 2011, the share price plummeted more than 70%. The solar industry that had been so successful and highly watched for years had been something of a bubble. Panel makers were producing in high quantities, but soon that supply outpaced demand.Panel prices fell as panel makers tried to sell the now-oversupplied panels. Meanwhile, Chinese companies were selling their even lower-priced panels in the U.S. and European markets, where domestic companies struggled to compete. Many solar companies went bankrupt. Others struggled with losses, oversupply, and low prices. And makers of polysilicon panels were hit the worst. Though First Solar’s panels weren’t quite as efficient, they were cheaper to produce. And that kept the company going. - See more at: <a href="https://www.energyandcapital.com/resources/first-solar-inc-nasdaq-fslr/64">energyandcapital.com</a></p>
			<p class = "text">SolarCity went into the solar industry picture in 2006 with a disruptive business model. The company buys, installs, owns and maintains photovoltaic panels on the roofs of its clients—homeowners, schools and commercial enterprises. SolarCity makes money by selling the electricity that’s generated from those panels, although it charges clients a rate lower than mainstream utility companies. The company did not manufacture the solar panels, so it was immune from the falling panel prices, and actually benefitted from that. SolarCity pioneered solar leasing and the option of panel installation with no upfront cost. With consumers avoiding maintenance and depreciating equipment (panels cost 70 percent less than they did in 2008), “the choice became paying more for dirty energy or less for clean”. With the success of its business model, since its IPO, the company's stock price has moved in the similar price range as its predecessor. - See more at: <a href="http://www.success.com/article/four-market-disruptors">success.com</a></p>
